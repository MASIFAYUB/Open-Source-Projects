Using the MSP430F5529 microcontrollers ADCâ€™s internal temperature sensor, 
which is placed on channel 10 of ADC. Getting temperature samples after 
specific intervals from ADC, converting them into digital values and displaying 
them on any serial terminal using UART with a Baud rate of 115200, no parity and one stop bit.
